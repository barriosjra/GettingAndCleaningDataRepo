###Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the R Code and docu files for the Data Science Track Course of DOST entitled "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The data set that is used comes from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

###Files Inside

1. A tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
3. A readME.md file that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. And the run_analysis.R file which contains the R script that merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, extracts measurements on the mean and computes the standard deviation for each measurement, uses descriptive activity names to name activities in the data set, appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names and creates and independent tidy data set mentioned in item number 1 above.
